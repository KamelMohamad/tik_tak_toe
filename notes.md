Background:

we need to create a tik tak toe game where we have a 3 * 3 board, 
the player should be able to place either  X or  O  in each cell, the user is able 
to place X or O only in empty cells. THe game ends when we have either a row or a column that has 
3 items from the same type (X or O ), or when the whole board cells are full( which means a draw ) 

POMODORO 1
create 3 by 3 board
  ✅ 3,3 ---> [any,any,any,
            any, any, any,
            any,any, any]

POMODORO 2:

✅ array elements should be OF ENUM TYPE
    ✅ CELL TYPE: ENUM. ENUM VALUE: EMPTY ---> [ EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY
                                                 EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY
                                                 EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY]
