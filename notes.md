Background:

we need to create a tik tak toe game where we have a 3 * 3 board, 
the player should be able to place either  X or  O  in each cell, the user is able 
to place X or O only in empty cells. THe game ends when we have either a row or a column that has 
3 items from the same type (X or O ), or when the whole board cells are full( which means a draw ) 

pomodoro : create a class representing 3 * 3 board called Board
input : an instance of  Board 
expected : the board has a 3 * 3 empty cells by default

work progress: 

    [x] write a test to check that a new instance of a Board has 3 * 3 cells 
    [] implement the Board to make the test succeed
